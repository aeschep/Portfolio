				Hello, my name is Anna Scheppele (pronounced shep-el-ee). I am currently a sophomore at the University of Michigan studying Information Science and minoring in Computer Science. I have just recently realized my love for programming and I am excited that I finally found a major that I am passionate about! I grew up playing a lot of video games (and still do) so I have always been interested in hardware and technology.

				I am from Canton, Michigan, which is in between Ann Arbor and Detroit. I grew up as a big sports fan in general. My grandparents were huge Detroit Tigers fans, so I have always loved baseball. When I was younger I used to play softball, tennis, soccer, and basketball. Eventually I quit everything except softball until I started playing tennis again my sophomore year in high school. One of my best decisions was to quit softball to play tennis again in high school because I had the best teammates I could ever hope for.

				 Family has always been a central part of my life. My dad is the youngest of ten kids, so his side of the family is pretty large and my mom is the youngest of three, so her family is smaller but they are all still local. My mom is my hero. She has had many hardships in life over the past ten years and has grown stronger from it all and I have learned to do so as well. I also have a brother who is four years older than me. Family life hasn't always been perfect, but I don't know what I would do without them.

				 I am a big lover of animals. Turtles are definitely my favorite animal and I collect all things turtle. I also love dogs a lot. I have two dogs at home, Loki and Odin. Loki is a pure bread Siberian Husky and Odin is a beagle hound mix. I find it amazing how much comfort and relaxation dogs can give you just by being around them and I really miss my goofy dogs while I'm at school.

				 Another thing I love to do is travel. It is my dream someday to travel all around the world and experience new cultures and beauty. I love to take pictures while traveling, especially of landscapes, nature, buildings, and animals (not really people). This is a picture of the Detroit and Windsor skyline at night taken from Belle Isle.
